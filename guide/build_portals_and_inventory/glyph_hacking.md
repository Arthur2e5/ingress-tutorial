# Glyph Hack

最近，Scaner 设备中发现了能使玩家看到一系列 Shaper Glyph 的代码。研究证明使用 Glyph 可增加 Hack 获得的道具数量，但是长期使用这一方法的结果仍然是未知的。

Quick tips

Two paths to unlocking Glyph power: Glyph hacks are either automatic or self-initiated. You can self-initiate Glyph hacking by long pressing the HACK portal button. Occasionally there will be a HIGH BONUS ENABLED Glyph sequence that will start automatically when hacking a Portal, regardless of whether you wanted to Glyph hack or not. If you successfully hack this sequence, your chance of getting bonus items will be higher than usual.
Forego the challenge: Touch BYPASS during self-initiated Glyph hacks to skip the sequence and initiate a normal hack without any bonuses. Touch ABORT during HIGH BONUS ENABLED Glyph hacks to skip the sequence and receive 0 AP and 0 items.
Roll of the dice: Completing a Glyph sequence successfully does not guarantee bonus items, it simply increases your chances of getting additional items.
Be ready for the challenge: The higher the Portal level, the more Glyphs you will need to successfully trace to unlock bonuses. For example, you may only need to trace 2 Glyphs to achieve the maximum hacking bonus for a low level Portal, whereas you will need to trace more Glyphs in order to achieve the same bonus on a higher level Portal.
Skill and speed: Your overall performance is based on the accuracy and speed in which you complete the sequence.
Beware of burnout: Glyph hacking is subject to the same cooldown and burnout limitations of normal hacks.
Be patient, start slowly, and have fun. Glyph hacking, like any skill, requires practice to achieve superior timing and precision.

To Manually Initiate Glyph Hacking:

Long press HACK portal while in the Portal menu to initiate the Shaper Glyph sequence.


Watch carefully and memorize the incoming Glyphs sent to your Scanner.


Trace the Glyph sequence before the time runs out to increase your chances of getting a bonus for your Hack.


Your chances of getting bonus items increase as you become faster and more accurate with tracing Glyphs.


If you get bonus items, they will be shown in your Hack results.
